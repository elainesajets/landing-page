# TOP Foundations landing page project

This is the first project in the TOP Foundation course. I am making a landing page based on an image provided.

I think there's still a lot I need to review in terms of Flexbox to completely understand how it all works together, as that was what I struggled with the most in this task. I'm also still not 100% if all the css I added is actually necessary or not. I used devtools coverage which gave me about 97.6%, however I feel like there is more CSS that may not actually be necessary.
